                        Gibson has produced three Jimmy Page signature models. The first was issued in the mid-1990s. 
                    It was based on a stock Les Paul Standard of the time (rather than the more prestigious and 
                    historically correct 1958/1959 re-issues issued by the Gibson Custom Shop). The modifications 
                    were based on Jimmy Page's "#2" 1959 Les Paul, which had been modified with push-pull 
                    potentiometers on all four control knobs, as well as mini push-pull switches under the pickguard. 
                    This first version of the Jimmy Page Signature did not have the mini-switches under the pickguard, 
                    nor did it replicate the custom-shaved neck profile of Jimmy Page's guitar, but it did include 
                    the four push-pull pots. With all four pots pushed down, the guitar operated as normal. Pulling 
                    up the tone pot for the Bridge or Neck pickup turned the respective pickup into a single coil, 
                    rather than humbucking pickup. Pulling up the volume pot for either pickup changed it from series 
                    (stock) to parallel. The first iteration of the Jimmy Page Signature utilized Gibson's then-current 
                    high-output humbuckers: a 496R in the neck position and a 498T at the bridge.
                        In 2005, after 2 years of research and development utilizing Jimmy Page's actual guitar, 
                    Gibson Custom Shop issued a limited run of Jimmy Page Signature guitars based on Jimmy Page's No. 1 1959. 
                    This time, Gibson worked directly from Jimmy Page's actual guitar, which he lent to Gibson for the project
                    The guitar featured just one push-pull pot, just like Page's No. 1, which reversed the phase of the pickups 
                    in the up position, which in Page's own words gave "a close approximation to the Peter Green sound.
                    " Gibson also went to great lengths to replicate the accuracy of the pickups, creating two custom 
                    pickups, which were available only in this guitar. The pickups were based on the Burstbucker 
                    vintage-style pickups, but featured stronger Alnico magnets and slightly higher output than the other 
                    Burstbuckers, as well as slightly higher treble response, which accurately reproduced the sound of the 
                    pickups in Page's guitar. Gibson also replicated the neck profile, which was heavily modified prior to 
                    Page acquiring the guitar, and the Grover tuners that Page favored.
                        Several years later, Gibson issued its third Jimmy Page Signature guitar, this one based closely 
                    on Jimmy Page's #2. Put out by the Gibson Custom Shop in an extremely limited run of 325 guitars, 
                    this guitar more accurately reproduced Page's heavily modified No. 2 than the original Signature model 
                    of the 1990s, and featured the 4 push-pull pots, the two mini-switches under the pick guard, accurate 
                    tuners and sound-accurate pickups (the same pickups that were used in the 2005 Jimmy Page No. 1 Signature), 
                    as well as an accurate neck profile. As in the original Signature model of the 1990s, pulling up the 
                    neck or bridge volume pots switched the respective pickups' coils from series to parallel, and pulling 
                    up the tone pots switched the respective pickups from humbucking to single coil. The two push-button 
                    DPDT switches mounted beneath the pickguard provide universal switching functions, regardless of the 
                    positions of the push-pull pots. With the switch mounted toward the bridge-end of the pickguard in the 
                    out position, the bridge pickup's phase is reversed. With the switch mounted toward the neck-end of the 
                    pickguard in the out position, both pickups are wired in series and out of phase. With both switches out, 
                    both pickups are in series and in phase. The Jimmy Page "Number Two" Les Paul is finished in the 
                    Gibson Custom Shop's painstakingly devised "Page Burst Version Two", a sunburst finish that accurately 
                    replicates the deep, rich, reddish-brown to amber appearance of the original guitar, and which has been 
                    approved by Page himself. With a total production number of 325 units, these are some of the most expensive 
                    guitars Gibson has ever issued. The initial 25, autographed by Jimmy Page, priced at as much as $25,000 
                    new, with prices rising in the collector market. Although gibson made 100 more with the same level of 
                    quality only the 25 remain signed.
